#AI Tools & Frameworks Assignment: Exploring Real-World AI Applications

Project Description This assignment serves as a comprehensive evaluation of my understanding of various AI tools and frameworks, their practical implementation, and their real-world applications. Through a blend of theoretical discussions, practical coding tasks, and ethical considerations, I demonstrate proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve specific problems.

The assignment is structured into three main parts: Theoretical Understanding, Practical Implementation, and Ethics & Optimization, with an optional bonus task for model deployment.

Tools & Resources Utilized Frameworks: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, spaCy

[If PyTorch was primarily used for Task 2, replace TensorFlow and adjust descriptions accordingly]

Platforms: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

Datasets: Iris Species Dataset, MNIST Handwritten Digits, Amazon Product Reviews (simulated/sample)
